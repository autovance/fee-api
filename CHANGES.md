# Stripe Fee API ChangeLog

## 2015-06-07, Version 1.1.0

### Notable changes

* **http**: Reverts the move of the `client` property of `IncomingMessage` to its prototype. Although undocumented, this property was used and assumed to be an "own property" in the wild, most notably by [request](https://github.com/request/request) which is used by npm. (MichaÃ«l Zasso) [#1852](https://github.com/nodejs/io.js/pull/1852).

* **transactions**: Adds the TransactionList.delete() function to facilitate rolling deletes, and makes use of it in the report event.
* **email**: Adds the EMAIL_SENDER environment variable to allow for custom email origins
* **report-event**: Adds the DELETE_THRESHOLD environment variable to allow users to define how much history they want to keep.
* **scheduled-task**: Adds the SELF_URL environment variable to ensure the scheduled task hits its own service.
